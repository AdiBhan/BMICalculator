# BMICalculator

 Using Tkinter, I created a simple and convenient GUI that allows you to find your BMI by entering your height and weight. 
 
 **For Users:**
 
 1. Download the .exe file and open the program. 
 
 2. Use the scrollbars to find your height and weight
 
 3. Click 'Calculate BMI' button


 **For Developers:**
 
 1. Download both the "BMICALC.py" and the "BMICALC_ICON.ico" files (Make sure to have them in the same folder)
 
 2. Open BMICalculator.py in your IDE and in the console type "pip install tk"
